# EDC Web Design — Copywriting Strategy (Challenger Framework)

## Core Philosophy (Apply to All Pages)

EDC Web Design copy should:

- Reframe the problem (not just describe services)
- Educate the visitor on why most websites fail
- Position EDC as a strategic partner, not a vendor
- Emphasize ROI, performance, and outcomes
- Reduce decision fatigue with clear CTAs

Tone:

- Confident, calm, authoritative
- Direct but not aggressive
- Helpful, not salesy
- Challenger-first, reassurance-second

Primary Buyer:

- Small business owners
- Contractors, service businesses, local brands
- Non-technical, time-poor, results-driven

---

## Global Elements (All Pages)

### Primary CTA

Use ONE primary CTA consistently across the site:
**“Launch My Site”** or **“Get a Free Website Audit”**

Secondary CTAs should only appear lower on the page.

### Language Rules

Avoid:

- “Beautiful websites”
- “Custom solutions”
- “Tailored to your needs”
- “High-quality design”

Prefer:

- “Conversion-focused”
- “Built to rank”
- “Optimized for speed and SEO”
- “Designed to generate leads”

---

## Homepage

### Goal

Immediately reframe the website from a visual asset to a revenue tool.

### Hero Section

Purpose: Challenger hook + authority + CTA

**Headline (Primary)**
Your website should bring you customers — not just exist.

**Subheadline**
Most small business websites look fine but fail at the one thing that matters: converting visitors into leads.

**Authority Line**
EDC builds high-performance websites designed for speed, search visibility, and real business growth.

**Primary CTA**
Launch My Site
(or: Get a Free Website Audit)

---

### Problem Reframe Section

Purpose: Teach the visitor why their current approach is flawed.

**Heading**
Why most websites don’t work

**Points**

- Built for aesthetics, not conversion
- Slow load times hurt Google rankings
- No clear call-to-action
- Not structured for local SEO
- Hard to update or scale

**Close**
A website isn’t a digital business card. It’s a sales system.

---

### Solution Section

Purpose: Position EDC as the alternative.

**Heading**
We design websites that perform

**Supporting Copy**
Our sites are built from the ground up to load fast, rank locally, and turn traffic into inquiries.

**Bullet Focus**

- Conversion-first layouts
- SEO-ready structure
- Modern, maintainable tech
- Mobile-first design
- Clear user journeys

---

### Proof / Credibility

Purpose: Reduce risk.

**Content**

- Tech stack (Next.js, Tailwind, SEO best practices)
- Client types served
- Results-oriented framing (no vague praise)

---

### CTA Section

Purpose: Close the page.

**Heading**
If your website isn’t bringing in leads, it’s time to fix it.

**CTA**
Launch My Site

---

## Services Page

### Goal

Sell outcomes, not deliverables.

### Hero

**Headline**
Design is not the goal. Results are.

**Subheadline**
We don’t just build websites — we build systems that help businesses grow.

---

### Service Breakdown (High-Level)

Each service should follow this structure:

**Service Name**
Outcome-driven headline

**Problem**
What’s broken in the typical approach

**EDC Approach**
How EDC does it differently

**Result**
What the business gains

Example:

- Local SEO Websites
- Conversion-Focused Redesigns
- Website Performance Optimization
- Ongoing Care & Growth

---

### Differentiation Section

**Heading**
Why most agencies miss the mark

**Copy**
Most agencies start with design. We start with strategy, search intent, and user behavior — because that’s what drives conversions.

---

### CTA

**Text**
Let’s build the right site for your business.

---

## Portfolio Page

### Goal

Reinforce credibility and strategic thinking.

### Intro Copy

**Headline**
Real websites built to perform

**Subheadline**
Every project is designed around the same goal: attract the right visitors and convert them into customers.

---

### Project Descriptions

Each project should include:

- Business type
- Problem before
- Strategy applied
- Outcome / improvement (qualitative if numbers aren’t available)

Avoid:

- “Client wanted a modern look”

Prefer:

- “Client needed more qualified inbound leads”

---

### CTA

**Text**
Want results like this? Let’s talk.

---

## About Page

### Goal

Humanize without weakening authority.

### Hero

**Headline**
Built by an engineer. Designed for growth.

**Subheadline**
EDC Web Design was created to help small businesses stop losing opportunities to underperforming websites.

---

### Story Section

Focus on:

- Technical background
- Obsession with performance and SEO
- Frustration with low-quality web design in the market

Avoid:

- Long personal biography
- “Passion for design” clichés

---

### Values

- Performance over polish
- Strategy before visuals
- Long-term thinking
- Clear communication

---

### CTA

**Text**
Let’s build something that actually works.

---

## Pricing Page

### Goal

Reframe price as an investment, not a cost.

### Hero

**Headline**
This isn’t a website cost. It’s a business asset.

**Subheadline**
Cheap websites are expensive when they don’t convert.

---

### Pricing Philosophy Section

**Copy**
Most businesses don’t need “more features.”  
They need a site that loads fast, ranks locally, and tells visitors exactly what to do next.

---

### Package Presentation Rules

- Focus on outcomes per tier
- Explain who each tier is for
- Emphasize what problems each tier solves

Avoid:

- Overwhelming feature lists
- Technical jargon without context

---

### Objection Handling

Address:

- “Why not Wix?”
- “Why not Fiverr?”
- “Why is this more than my last site?”

Frame answers around:

- Long-term ROI
- SEO and conversion impact
- Cost of rebuilding later

---

### CTA

**Text**
Let’s choose the right plan for your business.

---

## Contact Page

### Goal

Lower friction and reassure.

### Headline

Let’s talk about your website.

### Supporting Copy

Whether you’re starting fresh or fixing what you have, we’ll help you figure out the right next step.

---

### Form Guidance

- Keep fields minimal
- Set expectations:
  “We typically respond within 1 business day.”

---

### CTA

Start the conversation

---

## Locations Pages

### Goal

Local SEO + relevance without fluff.

### Structure

- Location-specific headline
- Local problem framing
- EDC solution adapted to the market
- Proof or examples if available

Example Headline:
Web design for businesses in [City]

Supporting Copy:
If your business serves customers in [City], your website should be optimized to show up — and convert — in that market.

---

## Final Notes for Implementation

- Each page should have ONE primary CTA
- Headlines must lead with outcomes or problems
- Avoid generic agency language at all costs
- Challenger tone should be strongest on Homepage, Services, Pricing
- Use short paragraphs and scannable sections

This copy strategy is designed to:

- Increase lead quality
- Justify premium pricing
- Differentiate EDC from commodity web designers
